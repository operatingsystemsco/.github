How to Build MS-DOS and the Windows Operating System
				
<p><a target="_self" href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/" data-test-app-aware-link="">MS-DOS Source</a></p>
<p>MS-DOS 1.25 was published on GitHub MS-DOS 1.25 was completely written in 8086 assembly so it needs to be assembled using an assembler (MASM and SCP 8086 Assembler). The object file(s) produced by MASM will then be linked to produce an executable which will then be converted to a raw binary executable (.COM). The .HEX files produced by SCP 8086 Assembler will be converted directly to raw .COM files using the HEX2BIN utility.</p>
<p>2. How to Make DOS?</p>

<p>This is as hard as the source code for the DOS BIOS (IO.SYS) was designed for Virtual Box and is not PC-compatible. Theoretically, the compiled binaries should work on Virtual Box but using the source code release by Microsoft alone will not produce a valid bootable disk as no source code for the boot sector is given. I do have access to the source code of the boot sector but as a result of Microsoft not releasing it publicly, I will not share it. This basically means with only the source code published by Microsoft, it is impossible to produce a working copy of MS-DOS 1.25.</p>
<p>3. What is Required</p>

<p>The following is required for compiling MS-DOS 1.25:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)</li>
   <li> Microsoft 8086 Object Linker (LINK)</li>
   <li> EXE to Binary Conversion Utility (EXE2BIN)</li>
   <li> Seattle Computer Products 8086 Assembler (ASM)</li>
   <li> HEX to Binary Conversion Utility (HEX2BIN)</li>
   <li> A copy of the MS-DOS 1.25 source code</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Details</p>

<p>The files STDDOS.ASM and MSDOS.ASM can be assembled to produce the DOS kernel and they are MASM compatible. All switches are set in the file STDDOS.ASM. MSVER generates binaries for MS-DOS with Microsoft copyright strings, IBM produces IBM PC-DOS binaries with IBM copyright strings. There is no need to change HIMEM and DSKTEST unless you want to experiment more with it.</p>

<p>COMMAND.ASM can be assembled using MASM to produce the command interpreter for MS-DOS. Just like the DOS kernel, you may use switches to produce both MS-DOS and IBM PC-DOS binaries. The HIMEM switch is also present.</p>

<p>ASM.ASM, HEX2BIN.ASM, IO.ASM and TRANS.ASM were written by SCP and must be assembled using their own assembler. IO.ASM have switches to configure the floppy disk controller and the Cromemco 4FDC is currently supported by The SIMH Altair 8800 Z80 simulator.</p>
<p>5. Compile It</p>

<p>Now, we are ready to compile MS-DOS 1.25 for the first time! If you are experienced in assembly, used those assemblers and tools listed above, then you should be able to get everything done by yourself. For those unable to assemble it on their own, my build disk will save your time.</p>

<p>Here is how to build MS-DOS 1.25 with the build disk: Download the build disk. Create a new virtual machine using your favorite emulator or hypervisor. Add a floppy drive, load the build disk. Start the virtual machine (it should boot from the build disk). Check the filenames using the DIR command and it should return: Type in MK <FILENAME> to assemble that particular component or MK ALL to assemble everything. Once you have everything assembled, type in DIR *.COM and DIR *.SYS to see the executable produced, it should be similar to: You have done it! You can now copy those executables to another disk or extract them or run them!

<p>You can compile the Lab 01 down to about 8 errors the rest of the Labs and Operating System shouldn't have any errors. You should have the research kernel to muck around with also from college, 
needing to comment out the Longhorn additions in revision 6000, files beginning with 'dp' are Longhorn files. The 'dp' files are not in the 'Longhorn' beta LDK they maybe in a IDW or internal developer workstation release if I can find one. 
Maybe look in Embedded 2009 for supported hardware and maybe learning what PCI hardware and coding the plug n' play to support in the NT Kernel. 
The PCI codes you can use now a days in 2024 is Linux and you might want to remove some of the cheap hardware.</p>

<strong>Lab01</strong>: Kernel
<pre>Copy the base\ntos directory and all of it's files to Lab01 it might be a virtual lab 
in source depot and it is a physical lab.</pre>
<pre>CD to base\busdrv\isapnp and use the message compiler to generate 'message.h'</pre>
<pre>Make pcicodes.h using the message compiler too. This file goes in base\busdrv\pci</pre>
<pre>build -cz </pre>

<strong>Lab05</strong>: Shared Source Common Language infustructure
<pre>However the Beta Wiki doesn't list a Lab 05 I believe it's either the SSCLI or the COM Stack. 
With the .NET Framework. To build the SSCLI you need Visual Studio 2005 Professional 
or higher in a 2000 or 2003 Virtual Machine. 
Active State Perl ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x64-296746.msi</pre>

and execute env.bat at the root of the directory. To set the free or checked 
environment then execute buildall.cmd To build the COM stack run build -cz 
in the root of the COM directory or lab.</pre>

<h2> Building a XP/2003 Embedded Runtime Image </h2>

"Use the Target Analyzer probes to create a comprehensive list of all hardware devices installed on the device. You can choose from either of the Target Analyzer probes, Ta.exe or Tap.exe. Ta.exe is a real-mode 16-bit application that can be run using Microsoft MS-DOS. Tap.exe is a protected Microsoft Win32-based application that runs on Microsoft Windows XP or Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack (SP) 2 OS that supports Plug and Play. Tap.exe produces a more complete and refined hardware list than Ta.exe.

The following list shows the hardware requirements for the Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Environment that is included on the Windows XP Embedded CD 1. 

A computer that can boot from an El Torito CD. 
A Pentium, preferably Pentium II or later, CPU. 
128 MB RAM. It is possible that 64 MB will work but it may cause a low memory error if networking is initialized. 
A display adapter that supports VESA mode video. 
After you have booted the device, run either Target Analyzer probe program, based on your needs. The Target Analyzer probe creates a file that contains the Plug and Play identifiers for each device installed on the target device. The default name for the .pmq file is Devices.pmq. Copy the device list to your development system

You create a configuration using one of the following two methods: 

Using the Target Designer import function. 
Using Target Designer to manually create a configuration. 
To import the device list 

To create a configuration based on the device list, run Target Designer. 
The device list is imported as a configuration into the configuration editor. 

1. From the File menu, choose Import. 
2. In the Choose File for Import dialog box, type the name of the device list, or browse to search for the file. 
3. Choose Import. 

There are four ways to add a component to a configuration in Target Designer: 

From the Configuration menu, choose Add Component. 
Drag the component from the component browser, and then drop it into the configuration editor. 
Right-click the component, and then choose Add. 
Choose the component in the component browser, and then choose Add on the toolbar. 

A dependency is a functional relationship between two or more components. Before building your configuration into a run-time image, you should run a dependency check to ensure that all the component dependencies have been resolved. 

To check your dependencies, choose the Configuration menu in Target Designer, and then choose Check Dependencies.

If the dependency check encounters components with unresolved dependencies, a task describing the requirement is automatically added to the Tasks list for each unresolved dependency.

You can locate a resolution by opening a task. The database shows only the component or components that can resolve the task. You simply select the check box for a component, and then choose OK.

For example, the following task may appear in the Tasks list:

COM Base [Version 1.0, R1] is dependent upon at least one of component 'RPCSS [Version 1.0, R4]'.

For this example, you would open the task. The task becomes a filter that searches the database for all components that contain the name RPCSS [Version 1.0, R4]. The Resolve Dependency dialog box then displays only the components containing RPCSS in the name.

Continue resolving tasks, closing each task as it is resolved. When all tasks have been resolved, run the dependency check again, because a new component added as a resolution may have other dependencies. Ensure that all dependencies are resolved.

The build process uses the information in a configuration to construct a complete run-time image. 

To build the run-time image 

1. From the Configuration menu in Target Designer, choose Build Target Image. 
2. In the Build type box, select Release. 
Note   Select Release even during development and when you are debugging an application. Select Debug if you are performing a low-level OS debug, such as debugging a device driver.
3. In the Destination box, type the full path where you want to store the new run-time image. 
4. In the Log file box, type the full path and file name for the log file. 
5. Choose Build.

After you have built your run-time image, you need to prepare your device for image deployment.

The BootPrep tool prepares your device for booting a Windows embedded system. The device must have an active partition that has been formatted and made bootable with a FAT16, FAT 16, or FAT32. The BootPrep tool replaces the partition boot sector code that would typically boot into MS-DOS by loading Io.sys and Msdos.sys with the code that loads the Windows NT loader, called NTLDR. 

Note  NTFS file systems are not supported by this utility. If you wish to use NTFS file system, you must create your initial file system using one of the FAT file systems and then use the Convert tool provided with Windows XP to convert your file system to the NTFS file system.

After you have prepared your device for deployment, you are ready to deploy the run-time image from your development system to your device. 

You can transfer the image using traditional methods such as disk, or bootable CD-ROM. You can also swap a storage device such as a hard disk drive or persistent storage module, such as ROM or flash memory or disk. You can also transfer the image electronically over a communications line. 

You can use the deployment tools to transfer, install, and configure the run-time image to your device. 

To create an ISO image of the Pre-FBA run-time image
Open a command prompt window. For example, from the Start menu, choose Run. In the Run Window, type: cmd 

Change to the Windows Embedded\utilities directory. For example: 
 
<pre>cd "\Program Files\Windows Embedded\utilities"</pre>  

Run the hd2iso utility. 

Select 1. Create an ISO-9660/El Torito bootable image file. The ISO image menu appears. 

Select 2. Select physical drive. The Select physical drive menu appears. 

Select the deployment hard disk. For example, select PhysicalDrive1. 

Select 3. Select partition(s). The Set partition(s) menu appears. 

Select the 650 MB FAT16 partition where the run-time image is located. For example, select Partition 1. Return to the Main menu by typing P. 

Select 4. Set image File path. The Image file path menu appears. 

Type the full path of where the ISO image file should be created. For example, C:\PreFBA.iso 

Select 5. Advanced Options. 

Choose 5. Select partition to boot. Select the first bootable partition. Return to the menu by typing P. 

Select 6. Create image. The hd2iso utility creates an ISO image based on the contents of the selected partition. 

After you have created the ISO image, create a CD-ROM from the ISO image by using CD creation software that supports ISO images. The CD-ROM that you create is the Pre-FBA run-time image CD-ROM. 

After you create your CD-ROM, you are ready to boot your run-time image and run the FBA process.

To run FBA, enable EWF, and run ETPrep on your run-time image
Copy the run-time image to the deployment hard disk. For example, use Windows Explorer, select the run-time image files in the Windows Embedded Images directory and drag and drop them to the deployment hard disk. 

Shut down your system and remove the power cable. 

Remove the development hard disk from the system. 

Attach the deployment disk to the primary IDE channel as master. 

Attach the CD-ROM drive to the secondary IDE channel as master. 

Reattach the power cable and power on the system. Insert the Pre-FBA CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. 

Configure your BIOS to boot from the hard disk. 

Boot your run-time image from the deployment hard disk and allow the FBA phase to finish. 

During the FBA phase, the system will reboot twice. 

To verify that EWF is configured, open a command prompt and run EWF manager. For example, type the following at a command prompt: 

<pre>ewfmgr</pre>

The following sample output is displayed.
  
Ewf Volume Configuration
Volume Size            64512
Segments               0
Segment Size           20

Max Protected Volumes  1
Protected Volumes      1
Overlay volume percent full 0.00
Protected volumes
Arc Path "\Device\HarddiskVolume1" [C:] 

Verify that EWF is configured to protect the C: drive by typing the following command: 
  
<pre>ewfmgr c:</pre>  

The following sample output is displayed: 

Protected Volume Configuration
Type            RAM
State           DISABLED

Max Levels      1
Clump Size      512
Current Level   1
Disk space used for data 0 bytes
Disk space used for mapping 0 bytes
Memory used for mapping 0 bytes 

If EWF is reporting errors, verify that EWF is configured properly by opening the C:\Windows\FBA\FBALOG.txt file. For more information, see Troubleshooting Enhanced Write Filter. 

After you have verified that EWF is properly configured, use the etprep /all command from a command line. This command will delete the EWF volume and configure the run-time image to boot from the CD-ROM drive. For example: 
 
<pre>etprep /all</pre>  

The system will immediately reboot. Do not reboot your post-FBA run-time image. Shut down the system and remove the power cable. 

Reattach the Windows Embedded Studio development disk to the system as a master disk on the primary IDE channel. 

Reattach the deployment disk to the system as the target disk on the primary IDE channel. 

Reattach the power cable and configure the BIOS to boot from the hard disk. 

Remove the Pre-FBA CD-ROM from the CD-ROM drive. 

Boot the development hard disk. 

After your run-time image is properly configured, you are ready to burn it to a bootable CD-ROM.

To create an ISO image of the post-FBA run-time image
Open a command line. 

Navigate to the Windows Embedded\utilities directory. For example, by typing the following command: 

cd "\Program Files\Windows Embedded\utilities" 

Run the hd2iso utility by typing: 

<pre>hd2iso</pre> 

Select 1. Create an ISO-9660/El Torito bootable image file. The ISO image menu appears. 

Select 2. Select physical drive. The Set physical drive menu appears. 

Select the deployment hard disk. For example, select PhysicalDrive1. 

Select 3. Select partition(s). The Set partition(s) menu appears. 

Select the 650 MB FAT16 partition where the run-time image is located. For example, select Partition 1. Return to the Main menu by typing P. 

Select 4. Image File path. The Image file path menu appears. 

Type the full path of where the ISO image file should be created. For example, C:\PostFBA.iso. 

Select 6. Create image. The hd2iso utility creates an ISO image based on the contents of the selected partition. 

After create the ISO image, you must create a CD-ROM from the ISO image by using CD creation software that supports ISO images. Simply copying the ISO image to the CD-ROM will not enable it to boot. You should use a third-party CD-ROM burning utility to create a CD-ROM from the ISO image. 

The CD-ROM that you create is the Post-FBA run-time image CD-ROM. 

Note:  
The CD-ROM may appear empty if it is viewed in Windows Explorer. This is because the contents of the bootable CD-ROM are written in a low-level language that Windows Explorer does not recognize.  

Your post-FBA CD-ROM is your bootable CD-ROM. You can immediately deploy this CD-ROM on your system.
 
If the target directory is not empty, Target Designer prompts you to confirm the deletion of the directory."
